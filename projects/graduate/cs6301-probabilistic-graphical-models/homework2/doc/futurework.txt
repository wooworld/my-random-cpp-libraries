Refactor LogNumber:
  Store LogType as member data to avoid messiness and inconsistencies.
    Also find the logic error in its math.
  Change global variables list to ArrayList<Integer> of domain size for each variable
    isEvidence and value are gleaned from the evidence HashMap
    ID is gleaned by its index in the list.
    Only remaining variable is the domain size, so just make that the value at the index.
  Speed up multiplySumOut
    Doing a multiply then a sumOut, can combine and make faster.
  Fix bucketElim alg to actually compute the right value
    For a BN this means stopping early to project evidence onto the last Function.
    For a MN this means never stopping.
