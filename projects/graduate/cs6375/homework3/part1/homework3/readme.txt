The program folders should be structured as such:
homework3/
  homework3.exe
data/
  ignore.txt
  stopwords.txt
  train.txt
  test.txt
  train/<input files>
  test/<input files>

The program expects 3 parameters on the command line:

homework2.exe <path to input files> <name of training index file> <name of testing index file>
Example:
homework2.exe ../data/ train.txt test.txt

NOTE:
  1) The path to input files MUST end in a path delimiter (/ on linux).
  2) The program must have write permissions for generating a temporary file!

train.txt and test.txt should have the format:
<class value>
<path to class' input files in the supplied data directory>
Example:
-1
train/ham/
1
train/spam/

You can specify any number of classes and a directory for each class. 

The program will then look for input files from the supplied data directory
and then in the specified class directories.
ie:
-1 in ../data/train/ham
1 in ../data/train/spam

NOTE:
Please look at the submitted file/directory structure structure if the above is not clear.

The results for runs for Perceptron accuracy and run times are in results.xlsx.
The results from the previous assignment's NB and LR runs are also there for 
comparison's sake.
The running times were generated using Visual Studio 9.0 with no debugging and
with compiler speed optimizations enabled. 

PROGRAM CONFIGURATION:
To configure the parameters listed in the results for the Perceptron only, 
alter the variables at the top of the files:
  Classifier.cpp: vocabDelimiters, minTokenSize, useIgnoreList, useStopWordsList
  PerceptronClassifier.cpp: eta, weightUpdateIterationsLimit
