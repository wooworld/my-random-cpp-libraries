/** 
 * \brief Type definition for a single uno card represented by a char.
 *
 * The Uno card is equivalent to a char type. A card's construction utilizes 
 * the bits of a char rather than its decimal value. 
 * The construction looks like this:
 *   
 * 76543210
 *
 * RGBYVVVV
 *
 * The R bit is 1 if the card is red. 
 * The G bit is 1 if the card is green.
 * The B bit is 1 if the card is blue. 
 * The Y bit is 1 if the card is yellow.
 * You may use more than one color, but it is not regulation.
 * The right-most 4 bits are reserved for the card's face value. So if the card
 * is a "red 8" card, its construction is 10001000. A "yellow draw two" 
 * is 00011100. Wild and Wild Draw Four cards have no color.
