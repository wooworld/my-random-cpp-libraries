There are 3 folders of interest:

  src - Contains the source code for the project. There should be a total of
        20 .cpp and .h files in the folder. 
        driver.cpp contains the main() function. uno_runner.cpp::run() contains
        the logic for the program as a whole.
  release - Contains the compiled project executable ready to play.
  doc - Contains an HTML user manual for the project. Has documentation on all
        functions and variables.
        
To compile the code:
1) Be using a Windows system. I use a couple variables in the Windows library.
2) Have a C++ compiler. I used Visual Studio 2008.
3) Just compile all of the .cpp files and then run the output executable.
4) Nothing else special. No additional libraries were included or installed.
