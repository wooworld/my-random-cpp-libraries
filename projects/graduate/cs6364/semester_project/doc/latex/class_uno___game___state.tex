\subsection{\-Detailed \-Description}
\-Holds the state of the game. 

\-Includes the players, whose turn it is, the unplayed and played cards, and, for an \-A\-I player, the evaluation score of the state.

\-A heuristic score evaluation for this state for an \-A\-I player. 

\-This value is rather meaningless for a real player, but for an \-A\-I player this represents how \char`\"{}good\char`\"{} a state is. \-A state that represents a loss for the player whose turn it is will have an extremely low value. \hypertarget{class_uno___game___state_ae274bd2383addaefbc78556c48757c35}{
