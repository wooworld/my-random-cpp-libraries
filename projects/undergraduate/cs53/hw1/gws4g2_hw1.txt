--Problem 2: Integer Divison with no Division--
1: Choose two integers
2: Determine the larger of the two integers after taking the absolute value of each, it shall be called A and the smaller of the two shall be called B
3: Make 2 more letters, they shall be called C and D, they starts at zero.
4: Check to see if C + B is bigger than A, if so skip to step 7
5: Add B to C, each time you add B to C, add 1 to D
6: Repeat steps 4 to 5
7: At this point, A/B using integer division has the answer of D

--Problem 3: Bunny Hunting Deciding which Gun to Use--
1: Wake up, say your prayers that it isnt a procelain or plastic bunny for today
2: Converse with mother to see what kind of bunny she wants us to shoot

--Problem 4: The Bunny Number Game--
1: There are 3 letters that corrospond to each position in the thre digit number, position 1 is A, 2 is B, and 3 is C
2: We first figure out the 1s position number by first guessing 0
3: The bunny returns either 1 or 0
    If the bunny returns 1 skip to step 4, if not contine guessing numbers for the 1 position, incrementing your guess by 1 each time
4: Next we figure out the 10s position number by again, guessing 0 first
5: The bunny returns either 1 or 0
    If the bunny returns 1 skip to step 4, if not contine guessing numbers for the 1 position, incrementing your guess by 1 each time
6: Next we figure out the 100s position number by again, guessing 0 first
    If the bunny returns 1 skip to step 7, if not contine guessing numbers for the 1 position, incrementing your guess by 1 each time
7: At this point, the bunny has returned the number 1 in each position at least once, which we can then concantenate our correct guesses to get the correct number
8: The bunny shrieks in horror, we shoot it, drag it back home, give it to mom and hope she cooks it right
