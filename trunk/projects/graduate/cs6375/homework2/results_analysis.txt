Q: Does the accuracy improve (by using stop words)? Why, why not?
A: For Naive Bayes when using a larger set of tokens to delimit the input files
   the accuracy increased by using stop words. When using only \n and space to
   delimit the input files, the accuracy decreased using stop words. Either way
   the accuracy for classificaiton did not change significantly. Additionally
   using stop words resulted in remarkably higher running times. It seems that
   the extra running time for the small increase in accuracy isn't really worth
   it.
   
   For Logistic Regerssion using stop words had no effect. The accuracy remained
   consistent either way and using stop words did not result in nearly as remarkable
   of higher running time as for Naive Bayes.
