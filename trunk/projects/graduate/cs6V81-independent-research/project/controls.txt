1) plug in Kinect
2) start application 
3) if it errors, close it, try again

4) hit N to toggle near mode on/off

5) close window when finished

After each frame the estimated hand pose is stored in a HandModel object.
This object can be used for anything, but in this application I simply
use it for rendering on top of the Kinect RGB image.
