<h3>CS347 SP2010 Puzzle Project Page - Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)</h3>

<i>Revision 1/12/2010. Note: it is the <b>students'</b> responsibility to check the CS347 website for possible new revisions!</i>

<p>The puzzle this semester is the classic symmetric Euclidean Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) [see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem</a>], a member of the family of touring puzzles. Let <i>n</i> be a positive integer. Given a set of <i>n</i>
cities and distances between each pair of cities with the distance
between each pair of cities being the same in either direction (hence
symmetric) and the distance between two cities corresponding to the
distance being their corresponding geographic locations (hence
Euclidean), find a Hamiltonian circuit with minimal total travel
distance. The solution format for this puzzle is a permutation of the
cities where an edge is implied between the first and last listed
cities. Legal moves are those that visit a new city or, if all cities
have been visited, return to the start city.

<p>Your program should read in the file specified by the user on the
command line, then generate a solution employing the algorithm
specified in below phase task grid and display the resulting final
solution (i.e., a solved state) following on the next line by the total
travel distance. The data files that you should test on and that the
grader will be using are: <a href="http://web.mst.edu/%7Etauritzd/courses/cs347/sp2010/problem1.tsp">Problem 1</a>, <a href="http://web.mst.edu/%7Etauritzd/courses/cs347/sp2010/problem2.tsp">Problem 2</a>, and <a href="http://web.mst.edu/%7Etauritzd/courses/cs347/sp2010/problem3.tsp">Problem 3</a>.</p>

<p>You should only submit a <b>single zip file</b> containing your
source code along with any additional dependencies your program has in
order to build your program, including but not limited to makefile,
Microsoft Visual Studio Project file, or alternative compile script, on
or before the due date specified in the below phase task grid. Your
program has to be able to compile on campus standard builds; testing on
these machines is therefore highly recommended! Also note that no
manual configuration by the grader should be necessary to compile and
execute your program; this should be handled by your makefile, MS
Visual Studio Project file, or alternative compile script. Submitting
is accomplished by following the instructions at <a href="http://web.mst.edu/%7Etauritzd/submission.html">http://web.mst.edu/~tauritzd/bbassignmenttool.html</a>.</p>

<p>Note: this is an individual project; plagiarism of any type will result in a zero grade.</p>

<p>While it is hoped that all code will be submitted error-free and on
time, this may not always be the case, so the following rules apply in
that case:
</p><li>You <i>must</i> make your final submission within four days of the due date. Submissions which are more than four days late will <b>not</b> be graded.</li>
<li>If your code is submitted late, a five percent per day penalty will
apply (fractions of days are rounded up), after four days you will
automatically receive a zero.</li>
<li>Resubmissions are allowed only until the submission deadline.</li><p></p>
